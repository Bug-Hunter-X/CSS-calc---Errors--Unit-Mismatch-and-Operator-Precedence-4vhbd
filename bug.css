The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results can occur due to unit mismatch or operator precedence issues. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` might not because of the missing 'px' unit.  Another potential problem is incorrect operator precedence; `height: calc(20px + 10px * 2);` will be calculated as `height: 40px` instead of `height: 40px` because of multiplication precedence over addition.
